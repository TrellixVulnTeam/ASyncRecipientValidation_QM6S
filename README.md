## Easy installation

Firstly ensure you have `node`:

Either by downloading directly and installing via: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Or by using the following instructions: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html

Get the project, and install dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/ZSamuels28/ASyncRecipientValidation.git
cd ASyncRecipientValidation
```

You can now type `node ./app.js -h` and see usage info.

## Pre-requisites

Set the following environment variables by creating a .env file within the ASyncRecipientValidation directory with the following information. Note these are case-sensitive:

```
SPARKPOST_HOST
    The URL of the SparkPost API service you're using. Defaults to https://api.sparkpost.com.

SPARKPOST_API_KEY
    API key on your SparkPost account, with Recipient Validation rights.
```

The .env file should look something like the following:
```
# .env
SPARKPOST_API_KEY=1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ
SPARKPOST_HOST=https://api.sparkpost.com
```

## Usage

```
node ./app.js -h
usage: ./app.js [-h] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE]

Validate recipients with SparkPost. Reads from specified input CSV file. 
Results to specified output file. Error rows are exported to the ErrorLog.csv file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INFILE, --infile INFILE
                        filename to read email recipients from (in .CSV
                        format)
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        filename to write validation results to (in .CSV
                        format)
```

## File input / output

Use the `-i` and `-o` options to specify input and output files.

An example input file is included in the project (valtest.csv) and can be seen below:
```
devon.herman58@gmail.com
sherman.goldner@yahoo.com
maurine83@yahoo.com
christophe86@yahoo.com
katheryn.mckenzie@gmail.com
moises.dickens@yahoo.com
fanny.buckridge@yahoo.com
ulises_rohan@gmail.com
```

The output file follows the same form as the SparkPost web application. Note that
*all* your address results are reported, not just the rejected ones (unlike the web UI validation).

Validations are made via an asynchronous API call so speed will be determined on machine capability 
as well as API rate limitations.

## Progress

Progress of email validations will be shown in the console in the following form:
`Done with [CompletedCalls] / [TotalValidEmails]`

When all APIs are completed, the following will be shown if all emails are valid:
`All emails successfully validated.`

If there are invalid emails found, the following will be shown:
```
Email validation completed with the following results:
Emails Successfully Validated: [CompletedCalls]
Emails with Errors: [InvalidEmails] (See Errorlog.csv for invalid emails)
```

## Invalid Email Syntax

The email syntax check uses regular expressions to ensure emails are in the valid format. Any invalid emails are then exported to the ErrorLog.csv file.
